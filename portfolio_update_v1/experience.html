        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>My experience with web development began with my undergraduate degree in 2002 when I studied Accountancy and Business Information Systems. I created websites using Dreamweaver and graduated with second class honors.</p>
        <p>My graduation was followed by 18 months in Bali, Indonesia where I worked online as a professional arbitrage gambler. My interest in risk and returned lead me to return to the UK and study an MA in Banking &amp; Financial Markets. Since graduating with Distinction I have pursued a career in financial services and day trading. I recently pursued some career advice due to a lack of fulfillment, and I have gone full circle, reigniting a real passion for coding.</p>
